## Identity

**DAZ Sentinel** is the cybersecurity division and specialist service line of **DAZ Consulting DS**.  
We operate at the intersection of **industrial EPC delivery**, **OT/ICS environments**, and **adversarial security** — where downtime, safety, and integrity are non-negotiable.

> **Industrial security is not a checklist.**  
> **It is engineered into governance before commissioning — and sustained through every year of production.**

## Strategic Focus

### Critical Infrastructure Security for Energy, Petrochemicals & Industrial EPC

DAZ Sentinel focuses on industrial environments where **operational continuity**, **process safety**, and **asset integrity** define risk — and where cyber exposure is often introduced long before operations begin (engineering, vendors, temporary networks, contractors).

**Typical objectives**
- Reduce real attack surface across **hybrid IT/OT** boundaries
- Establish **governance that survives handover** (not “project-only controls”)
- Make security measurable: **exposure → controls → verification → operating discipline**

## Core Service Lines

### OT / ICS Security Advisory (Lifecycle)

Security assurance across the full project and operating lifecycle:
- **FEED / Design**: zoning, trust boundaries, secure architecture requirements  
- **Construction & Commissioning**: temporary infrastructure exposure, contractor access governance  
- **Handover & Operations**: visibility, patching reality, remote access discipline, monitoring foundations

### Red Team for Hybrid IT/OT

Structured adversarial simulations designed for industrial reality:
- attack surface and pathway modelling (IT/OT boundary)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping (enterprise + ICS where applicable)
- findings translated into **engineering controls** and **governance actions**

### EPC Cyber Governance

Cyber risk integrated into project control discipline:
- schedule governance and critical-path risk factors
- cost integrity / forecasting implications of cyber events
- contractual risk allocation and responsibility model (Owner / EPC / Vendors)

### Mobile & Field Security

Risk reduction for executive and field operations:
- device hardening and secure workflows
- contractor access vectors and temporary site connectivity
- exposure reduction for travel and on-site operations

## How Engagements Run

1) **Executive framing (risk & business impact)**  
2) **Engineering discovery (architecture & exposure)**  
3) **Verification (what is true, not what is declared)**  
4) **Governance embedding (controls that persist after handover)**
