### Identity

DAZ Sentinel is the cybersecurity division and specialist service line of **DAZ Consulting DS**.  
It integrates offensive security methodology with EPC delivery governance — to protect critical infrastructure across the full project lifecycle.

## Strategic Focus

### OT / ICS Security in Energy & Petrochemicals
Security assurance for industrial environments where downtime, safety and integrity are non-negotiable:
- segregation and zoning risk analysis (IT/OT boundary)
- temporary infrastructure exposure during construction and commissioning
- contractor access governance and asset visibility

### Red Team Methodology for Hybrid IT/OT
Adversarial simulations designed to measure realistic exposure:
- attack surface analysis and pathway modelling
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping (enterprise + ICS where applicable)
- findings translated into engineering controls and governance actions

### EPC Cyber Governance
Cyber risk integrated into project control discipline:
- schedule and critical path risk factors
- cost integrity and forecasting implications
- contractual allocation of cyber responsibilities across EPC packages

### Mobile & Field Security on Industrial Sites
Industrial reality: smartphones, tablets, radios, temporary networks.
- field-device exposure assessment
- access token / identity hygiene
- operational constraints and pragmatic controls

## Operating Principle

Industrial security is not a checklist.
It is an engineering discipline embedded into governance — defined before commissioning and built to endure long after production begins.
