## Service Model

DAZ Sentinel delivers **executive-grade security** with **engineering depth** for **critical infrastructure** — spanning **EPC delivery** and **operating production assets**.  
Engagements are structured to produce outcomes that remain defensible over time: **scope, evidence, decisions, and follow-through**.

---

## OT / ICS Security Advisory

### Where it fits (Lifecycle)
- **FEED / design**: security requirements (zoning, conduits, trust boundaries)
- **Construction**: contractor/vendor access governance; temporary infrastructure exposure
- **Commissioning**: hardening in the reality of handover pressure
- **Operations**: monitoring foundations, remote access discipline, asset visibility

### What you receive
- OT security posture assessment (**architecture + exposure reality**)
- zoning / segmentation recommendations with **prioritised implementation**
- OT access governance model (**roles, approvals, evidence**)
- operations-ready control set (**what persists after handover**)

---

## Red Team Engagements (Hybrid IT/OT)

### Purpose
Adversarial simulation designed for industrial reality — focused on **pathways that translate into operational impact**, not theatre.

### What you receive
- attack surface & pathway model (**boundary-centric**)
- evidence-based findings and exploitation narrative (**where permitted**)
- mapped controls: **engineering actions + governance decisions**
- executive briefing: **risk, cost of inaction, decision points**

---

## EPC Cyber Governance

### What it solves
Cyber risk is too often treated as “IT policy” while EPC delivery is governed by **schedule, cost, packages, interfaces, and handovers**.  
This service embeds security into delivery governance — so controls survive pressure, vendors, and turnover.

### What you receive
- governance blueprint aligned to **project phases and gates**
- accountability model (Owner / EPC / Vendors) with **contractual implications**
- integration with project controls: **schedule/cost impact lines + reporting structure**
- audit-ready traceability: **decisions → controls → verification**

---

## Mobile & Field Security

### Focus
Exposure reduction for executives and on-site teams **without breaking productivity**.

### What you receive
- hardened baseline configuration and operating practices
- practical controls for travel and field operations
- contractor access workflows and device hygiene standards

---

## Engagement Format

- **Discovery** — scope, constraints, evidence sources  
- **Engineering Assessment** — architecture + exposure  
- **Verification** — reality check: configs, pathways, operational behaviour  
- **Embedding** — governance + handover-resistant controls  

---

## Notes

DAZ Sentinel is a **cybersecurity division and specialist service line of DAZ Consulting DS**.  
Services can be delivered as advisory, verification, or structured programmes — depending on governance maturity and lifecycle phase.
