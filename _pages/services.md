## Service Model

DAZ Sentinel delivers **executive-grade cybersecurity** with **engineering depth** for industrial EPC and operating assets.  
Work is structured to produce outcomes that are defensible: scope, evidence, decisions, and follow-through.

---

## OT / ICS Security Advisory

### Scope (Lifecycle)
- FEED / design security requirements (zoning, conduits, trust boundaries)
- contractor and vendor access governance
- temporary networks during construction and commissioning
- operational handover: monitoring foundations, remote access discipline, asset visibility

### Deliverables
- OT security posture assessment (architecture + exposure reality)
- zoning / segmentation recommendations with implementation priorities
- OT access governance model (roles, approvals, evidence)
- operations-ready control set (what persists after handover)

---

## Red Team Engagements (Hybrid IT/OT)

### Purpose
Adversarial simulation tailored for industrial reality — focused on pathways that create operational impact.

### Deliverables
- attack surface and pathway model (boundary-centric)
- evidence-based findings and exploitation narrative (where permitted)
- mapped control recommendations (engineering + governance)
- executive briefing: risk, cost of inaction, and decision points

---

## EPC Cyber Governance

### What it solves
Cyber risk is often treated as “IT policy” while projects run on schedule, budget, packages and handovers.  
This service integrates cyber into delivery governance.

### Deliverables
- governance blueprint aligned to project phases and gates
- responsibility model (Owner/EPC/Vendors) and contractual implications
- project control integration: schedule/cost impacts and reporting structure
- audit-ready traceability: decisions → controls → verification

---

## Mobile & Field Security

### Focus
Executive and on-site exposure reduction without breaking productivity.

### Deliverables
- hardened baseline configuration and operating practices
- risk controls for travel and field operations
- contractor access workflows and device hygiene

---

## Engagement Format

- **Discovery** (scope, constraints, evidence sources)  
- **Engineering Assessment** (architecture + exposure)  
- **Verification** (reality check: configs, paths, operational behavior)  
- **Embedding** (governance + handover-resistant controls)

---

## Notes

DAZ Sentinel is a **division of DAZ Consulting DS**.  
Services can be delivered as advisory, verification, or structured programs — depending on governance maturity and lifecycle phase.
